            <h1> For an ordinary person, anything related to cyber security seems abstract and cryptic.</h1>
            <p>The truth is that most people simply do not care enough about their online safety to pay for extra device, unless it's simple, delightful and does not require an extra effort to maintain. Simplicity and humanity were the key tenets to inform everything from the device itself, to the user experience of the app.</p>

        <h1>CUJO app allows to monitor and control activity on your wifi. The app is focussed around two key use cases - monitoring devices on network and alerting about threats.</h1>
        <div class="d-flex justify-content-between flex-gap sm-responsive-flex">
            <div class="flex-item">
                <p>To redefine the architecture of the app, we asked our users to define what are some of the most important questions that come to mind about their home network. Those were shortlisted to top 3:</p>
                <ol class="mt-3" style="padding-left: 1.2rem !important;">
                    <li>Am I exposed to any threats?</li>
                    <li>What devices are active on my Wi-Fi? What is their activity?</li>
                    <li>What are my children doing online. How can I prevent them from seeing the bad stuff?</li>
                </ol>
            </div>

            <p class="flex-item">
                From a series of prototypes, we landed on a tab-based app architecture, each dedicated to a specific aspect of the network: threats, devices, parental controls, and a dashboard with an overview of recent threat and user activity. A card-based UI allowed to easily scale the dashboard as additional features were developed.

        <h1>Protecting children from the bad stuff is increasingly important for families whose kid's are taking their first steps online. We designed a simple yet powerful UI for content control, scheduling and profiles.</h1>
        <div class="d-flex justify-content-between flex-gap sm-responsive-flex">
            <p class="flex-item">
                At the top of app's most requested features were parental controls. Our users wanted to be able to control what their kids are doing online, and prevent them from seeing malicious content or interactions. The framework had to be simple, yet flexible enough to support individualized restrictions (e.g. teenagers and younger kids in the same family needed different levels of access), and assign those to specific schedules (e.g. completely disabling online activity during the bedtime). 
            </p>

            <p class="flex-item">
                Drawing on our conversations with the families, we reimagined the schedules as cards, each dedicated to a time-frame in child's' routine, such as homework or bed time. One tap interaction allows to quickly adjust time, days and restrictions applicable to the schedule.

            <h1> Building on access controls, we could provide additional value by displaying aggregate usage data for each profile</h1>
            <p>We extracted the most meaningful metrics (number of threats, most visited sites, and time spent in each content category) from the profile's online activity, and visualized them as cards with a summary of each data point. As a result, we could provide our users with an additional incentive to user the access controls, by giving insight as to what their kids are doing online. </p>

        <p>Apart from the ease of use, the simplicity of parental controls' set up was crucial. Analyzing the funnel of , we were able to identify their biggest pain points and streamline the flow for the least amount of steps and highest completion ratio. </p>

            <p>Significant part of our user base being cyber security professionals looking to secure their homes, we felt the need to activate and involve our community. As a collaboration between us and community a Cyber Neighborhood Watch was born. CNW is a live feed of blocked and new threats submitted by our users worldwide. Each submission is visualized in the app and submitted to CUJO cloud for review. </p>

                <h1>Design system</h1>
                <p>
                    The complex nature of the app necessitated more than 70 screens covering user on-boarding, Wi-fi setup, support and power user features like port forwarding.

                To maintain consistency and ensure efficient design to dev handover, I developed a modular design system based on reusable components and their states, such as cards, list items, and controls. Every component can be rearranged and combined with others while maintaining design consistency and recognizable UI patterns for the user.
